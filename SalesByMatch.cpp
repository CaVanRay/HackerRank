 Title: Sales By Match
 Author: Cavan Ray Theiss

 Description: Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, 
 determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.

 Input: a single integer n representing how many socks are in the pile, and an 
 array of integers representing the colors of each sock
 
 Output: a single integer representing the number of matching pairs in the pile
*/

int pairsFound;
vector<int> pendingMatches, tempPile;
 
 for(int i = 0; i < n.size(); i++){
  while(!pendingMatches.empty()){
   if(pendingMatches.back() ==)

   /*
   NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:  I'm really fucking tired, but this will be a double stack, if a match is found it is removed
   and the pairsFound counter goes up, everything else resets, otherwise everything in temp is moved back to pendingMatches
   along with the new sock
