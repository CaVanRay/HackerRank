Title: BST maintenance
Author: Cavan Ray Theiss
Description: given a series of numbers build out a binary tree and once done
return the total size of all distances between every node on the tree
Input: Vector of integers that will be used to build the binary tree
Output: Vector of integers that show the total distances between nodes after each
item is added to the binary tree

/* 
asking for a walkthrough of the logic needed for this problem gave chatgpt an aneurysm 

I'm going to pen & paper for the rest of the day, work on the logic in my freetime & 
hopefully have an idea of how I'm gonna do this tomorrow morning

I think this is a monotonic stack problem, but I still can't work out the logic

I'm gonna try to figure it out tonight after work, but i might also just go to sleep
worst case scenario I'll work on it tomorrow

Example:

output - 0, 1, 4, 10, 20, 35, 52, 76
