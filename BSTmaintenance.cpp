Title: BST maintenance
Author: Cavan Ray Theiss
Description: given a series of numbers build out a binary tree and once done
return the total size of all distances between every node on the tree
Input: Vector of integers that will be used to build the binary tree
Output: Vector of integers that show the total distances between nodes after each
item is added to the binary tree
 */

/* 
I think I found finger-hold

in a simple 2 leg tree the total length increases at a regular predictable rate

*/
