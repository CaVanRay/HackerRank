Title: BST maintenance
Author: Cavan Ray Theiss
Description: given a series of numbers build out a binary tree and once done
return the total size of all distances between every node on the tree
Input: Vector of integers that will be used to build the binary tree
Output: Vector of integers that show the total distances between nodes after each
item is added to the binary tree

asking for a walkthrough of the logic needed for this problem gave chatgpt an aneurysm 

I'm going to pen & paper for the rest of the day, work on the logic in my freetime & 
hopefully have an idea of how I'm gonna do this tomorrow morning
