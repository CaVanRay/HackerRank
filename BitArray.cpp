I hate when they make questions more convoluted than they need to be on purpose. 
Just because a question is easy to answer doesnt mean you should go out of your way to make it difficult to understand.

I got chatgpt to translate what they want:

Youâ€™re given four numbers (N, S, P, Q). Use them to make a sequence with this rule:

First number is S mod 2^31.

Each next number = (previous * P + Q) mod 2^31.

Now, from the first N numbers you generate, just count how many are different and print that number.

    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */   
    return 0;
