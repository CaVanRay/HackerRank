/*

you will be given  queries. Each query is of one of the following three types:

    Add an element  to the set.
  
    Delete an element  from the set. (If the number  is not present in the set, then do nothing).
  
    If the number  is present in the set, then print "Yes"(without quotes) else print "No"(without quotes).

Here are some of the frequently used member functions of sets:

      set<int>s; //Creates a set of integers.
    
      int length=s.size(); //Gives the size of the set.
      
      s.insert(x); //Inserts an integer x into the set s.
      
      s.erase(val); //Erases an integer val from the set s.
      
      set<int>::iterator itr=s.find(val); //Gives the iterator to the element val if it is found otherwise returns s.end() .
  Ex: set<int>::iterator itr=s.find(100); //If 100 is not present then it==s.end().

*/

int main() {
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */   
    return 0;
}
